# Project for extended BlueSkyStatistcs


My goal is to expand the community of users of the BlueSky [Statistics SoftWare](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjDjJegoL6AAxUC1AIHHey0B2MQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blueskystatistics.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1hTkA70OClOGPoFm0YbgpE&opi=89978449). Definitely, with the expansion of the users of this software, there will be an increase in the number of people interested in the R programming language.


## The contents of this repository

Now, this repository contains the links of the videos that I have recorded for the training of this software. Also, the files have been placed in order to familiarize science enthusiasts with some of the statistical concepts used in this software.


## Code Blocks
